# netflix-blocker-extension

I watch too much Netflix, so I made [an extension to help](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-blocker/kndljagkkhoakcjgbhdghldmnkbbbahg).

When you navigate to netflix.com, Netflix Blocker takes over the screen to ask you if you have anything more productive you could be working on. It gives you an option to close the tab, or continue to Netflix.
